### **Python driver for PCF8574 8bit IO Expander board**
Developed for the Raspberry Pi, requires the python-smbus2 package to access the I2C bus.

tested on raspberry pi 3b plus with two PCF8574 boards.


First install smbus2 using:
`pip3 install smbus2` 

then install the actual package using:
`pip3 install pcf8574-io`


Usage Example:
```python
import pcf8574_io

# you can use up to 8 PCF8574 boards 0x20 and 0x21 are the I2C addresses
# true will set all the pins HIGH +3.3v false will set them to LOW 0v 
p1 = pcf8574_io.PCF(0x20)
p2 = pcf8574_io.PCF(0x21)

# p0 to p7 are the pins name
# INPUT or OUTPUT is the mode
p1.pin_mode("p0", "INPUT")
print(p1.digital_read("p0"))

# you can write and read the output pins
# use HIGH or LOW to set the pin HIGH is +3.3v LOW is 0v
p1.pin_mode("p4", "OUTPUT")
p1.digital_write("p4", "HIGH")
print(p1.digital_read("p4"))

# you can read and write up to 8 boards at the same time just make sure you ech board has a different address
p2.pin_mode("p7", "OUTPUT")
p2.digital_write("p7", "LOW")
print(p2.digital_read("p7"))
```

Note: the board has only 25mA output current so if you want to control some relay modules,
that need more than 25mA use more than one pin to control each relay.
